# note-tagger

This is a small web-app designed to provide a tag-based structuring of notes.

Authors: Michel Momeyer and Alastair Van Maren


Vision: With this app we hope to create a tag system for keeping track of and organizing systems of brief(ish) notes. Tags would be user-defined (albeit with a few defaults), and arbitrarily selectable. Selecting them will filter out existing notes to just those with the selected tags (either by AND or OR filtering). Tags will likely be at the top, with notes in a scrollable list to the left, and the selected note, with its editable content and the tags applied to it, on the right. See the UI mockup and design for more details.
