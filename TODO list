Features

Add a search bar
================
1. Needs an endpoint that takes in a search string and returns documents with a title (or text that contain that word)
    -- needs to return pretty much the full document info for each...
        + name and ID especially
        + but displaying tags or short sentence of matching content would be awesome

2. Need a component at the App level to do that
    --> by selecting a searched for document --> selectedNote set to that ID
    --> selected tags would need to then match our document's tags

3. Needs a nice looking dropdown interface...


Tag auto-completion
===================
1. Need a component OR a change to TagCreator
    + calls an endpoint to return all tags (/tags?)
    + onChange={filterTagsForWords}
    + popup a drop-down like "display" that a tag can be selected (tab and arrow key support)


Image Copy-and-Pasting-ing
==========================
1. look at tutorials online
2. need a way of storing images in MongoDB
3. need a way of intercepting CTRL-V and other paste commands
4. need to be able to dynamically add images into what's essentially a text field
    - maintain everything as an HTML component with "embedded" images
    - still need to be able to add text before/after images
5. want to be able to click and drag images around in note area


Modern Visual Aesthetic
=======================
- Either look at colors and placement with CSS as we've been doing
- "steal" CSS from online
- find a React component library that provides nice aesthetic options for the buttons and things we're interested in
